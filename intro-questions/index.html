			<li>My name is Julia Dickerman. I am a senior computer science major with a minor in art.</li>
			<li>I have web development experience and I have learned some design principles through my other sam fox classes, but I have never taken a course specifically for the design element of creating websites. I know a lot about functionality but not about how to make things look the way I want.</li>
			<li>I have pretty extensive experience with html and javascript. I TA a web development class that is all about functionality and not about appearance. I have used basic CSS but nothing too fancy.</li>
			<li>I hope to learn about what makes for good website aesthetics and how to add that while maintaining a user-friendly interface.</li>
			<li>I haven't done much designing on paper, but I know that a screen can make it more difficult to place things, esp with different screen sizes. I've also found that colors can look really different across devices.</li>
			<li>I think the <a href=https://whitney.org/>Whitney Museum Website</a> exemplifies effective design. The black and white color palette match the museum itself while letting the artworks featured to stand out. The font is large and easy to read, and the site is as a whole uncluttered and easily navigable. There are also nice design elements like the header shrinking when you scroll and the links turning black on hover.</li>
			<li>I think the <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/>New York Times Website</a> exemplifies effective communication because it is very simple and easy to read. They chose the format to replicate the newspaper that their readers are used to, but they made all the articles conveniently clickable. It's the right amount of following an expected pattern with the right amount of adaptation to the digital world.</li>
			<li>I think that the <a href=https://reactjs.org/>React Website</a> works well because it is simple, fast, and everything the user would want is easy to find and navigate to. All of the info pages have an overview that allows you to jump to different sections. The site is clean and easy to read with no distractions.</li>

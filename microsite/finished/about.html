		<h1 class="page-title">About Relay FM</h1>
		<p>In 2015, many podcasts moved under the Relay FM network and added to the diversity of the hosts and topics. Christina Warren, Brianna Wu, and Simone de Rochefort from Rocket; Aleen Simms from Less Than or Equal; Tom Gerhardt and Dan Provost from Studio Neat; Yasmine Evjen, Andy Ihnatko, and Russell Ivanovic from Material; and David Sparks and Katie Floyd from Mac Power Users all joined the network or started new shows since Relay FM's inception.</p>
		<p>When the podcast network launched, it had five shows: Analog(ue), Connected, Inquisitive, The Pen Addict, and Virtual. Eventually the company expanded to 30 live shows on the network (including to the extra B-Sides podcast consisting of before and after show snippets and Departures which is the audio feed of live events), nine paid members only shows, and 16 retired shows (four of which have been replaced by similar programs, while one of those replacements has itself ended).</p>
		<p>On 9 October 2015, Relay FM launched its mobile application, allowing users to discover new shows, listen to the latest shows, and be notified when their favorite show is broadcasting live. Users of the app can also subscribe to shows in their podcast app of choice from the Relay FM app. It is currently available on iOS only.</p>
		<p>In September 2019, Relay FM became the first St. Jude Children's Research Hospital podcast partner. On the 20th, Hurley and Hackett hosted a 6 hour "podcastathon" to help raise money for the hospital. By the end of the month, the network had raised over $300,000. In September of 2020 the network again held a fundraiser for St. Jude, bringing in $456,000.</p></div>
